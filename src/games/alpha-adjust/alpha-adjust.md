## Description

A very simple game to learn the basics of Phaser 3.

## Learning objectives

You will learn how to create and initialize the core class Phaser.Game and
if you have a deeper look into the GameConfig object you will see all the
parameters you can choose when setting-up your Phaser.Game Instance (see further reading).

You will learn how to adjust the alpha value of a Phaser.GameObjects.Image
and how to detect a mouse click.

## How to run it

Adjust the entry path in the `webpack.config.js` file as follows:
```
entry: './src/games/alpha-adjust/game.ts'
```
