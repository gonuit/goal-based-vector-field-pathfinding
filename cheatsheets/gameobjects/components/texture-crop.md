## Phaser.Components.TextureCrop

In case of doubt, the [official source code](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) should be accessed.

### Public Functions

#### setCrop
Applies a crop to a texture based game object (f.e. sprite or image).

> Cropping a game object does not change its size, dimensions, physics body or hit area, it just
changes what is shown when rendered.

#### setTexture
Set the texture and frame this game object will use to render with.

> Textures are referenced by their string-based keys, as stored in the texture manager.

#### setFrame
Set the frame of the game object.

> Either a string or an index.
